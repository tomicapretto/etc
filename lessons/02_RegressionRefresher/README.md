# Regression Refresher

## Concepts Introduced

- Exploratory data analysis
- Linear regression
    - No predictors
    - Numeric predictors
    - Numeric and categoric predictors
- Transformations
- Predictions
- Uncertainty evaluation

## Section Summaries

### 10. Introduction

- You are a data scientist at a company that sells fish
- You want to create a model to predict the weight of future fish
- How we are going to tackle all the challenges in this lesson

### 20. Exploratory Data Analysis

- We need to know our data before modeling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) allows us to
    - Get familiar with the data and the problem
    - Anticipate modeling challenges
    - Build intuition around plausible results

### 30. Making a Plan

- Planning takes time, but it's an investment with a high ROI 
- Guides us through the process of growing a model step by step 

### 40. The World's Simplest Model

- The simplest model does not have any predictors
- It's just a smoothed version of the mean

### 50. Adding a slope

- How to add a predictor to the model
- The regression line becomes non-flat
- Modeling requires thought. Results are not always the best from the very beginning

### 60. Transformations

- Transformations are a very powerful tool
- They allow us to
    - Turn non-linear relationships into linear ones
    - Convert bounded variables into unbounded ones 

### 70. Accounting for species

- Add a non-numerical predictors into a regression model
- Intuitive: Split the regression line into multiple lines
- Flexible: These lines can differ in multiple ways

### 80. New fish arrive

- Use the model to predict the weight of new fish
- Analyze the predictions

### 90. From predictions to insights

- Translate the predictions into actionable insights
- Communicate in the same language than the business

### 100. Bayesian Workflow and Growing Pains

- Make the model more complex, including more predictors
- Larger models require more care
- Larger models aren't necessarily better
