We did this because we mentioned it was the most flexible approach. However, when we analyzed the posterior estimates we noticed the slope posteriors were all quite similar, meaning regression lines for the species were indeed parallel. Because of this, it makes sense to have a single slope parameter instead of multiple ones, which reduces the complexity of the model a little.\n",
